File::path refers to a class method and File#path refers to an 
instance method.

File::path returns the string representation of the parameter
and File#path returns the pathname and does not normalize the name.
Furthermore, it raises an IOError for a file created using
File::Constants::TMPFILE because it does not have a path name.
File::Constants::TMPFILE is used to create an unnamed temporary
file, that does not have a path.
