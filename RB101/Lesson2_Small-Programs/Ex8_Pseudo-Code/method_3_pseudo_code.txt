# functionality #
method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array
with every other element

# reasoning #
i.e, process one, ignore one, process once, ignore one, ...
so every second entry in the array should be ignored

# casual pseudo-code #
create an empty array to be returned as the result
iterate through the array starting at index ''
  if index % 2 is 0
    - add to the new array
  else 
    - go to next iterationr

return the new array


# formal pseudo-code #

START
 # given an array of integers called 'numbers'

 # create new array to accumulate every second number in the array
 SET accum = empty string

 # iterate and skip every other number
 # add the processed ones to the new array
 SET iter = 0
 WHILE iter < numbers.size
  if (iter % 2) == 0
    add numbers[accum] to the new array
  increment iter by 1

 # return the resulting array that contains every second number
 # of the orginal array
 RETURN accum
