# Q2
1) operator that checks whether it's 2 operands are 'not equal'
2) inverts the truthiness of it's operand, since in ruby a string is
   truthy, using the bang operator on a string makes it falsey
3) the bang operator is usually used at the end of destructive
   method names. In order to call the .! method on an object, and have the
   same effect as preceeding it with the bang operator, the dot notation
   has to be used.
4) no meaning, syntax error?
5) ? at the end of a method call, which is convention if a method returns
   true or false
6) negation of negation which end up the same as using no bang operator at all
