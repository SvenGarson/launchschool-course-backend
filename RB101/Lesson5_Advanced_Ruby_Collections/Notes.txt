- type of actin performed?
- what object is the action performed on?
- side effects? [output?; destructive?]

Line x || a - b:
    - Action            => Method call / Block exec. / conditional / ...
    - Object            => Object method is called on / arguments / ...
    - Side Effect       => n/a
    - Return value      => return value of expression / statement / message / ..
    - Return value used => does anything use that return value ?
