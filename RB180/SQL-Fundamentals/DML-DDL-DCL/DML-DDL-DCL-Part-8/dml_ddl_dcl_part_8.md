The SQL statement:

```sql
DELETE FROM things WHERE item = 'Cup';
```

uses the `DML` - Data Manipulation Sub-Language because:

- data is manipulated in that __record(s) are deleted__ from the table, __if__ the operation is successfull
- `DELETE` is part of the `CRUD` operations
- the __structure/schema__ of the __table/database__  is __not changed__ in any way
