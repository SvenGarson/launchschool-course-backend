The SQL statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO things VALUES (3, 'Scissors', 'Metal');
```

uses the `DML` - Data Manipulation Sub-Language because:

- The table data is __manipulated__ in that we __INSERT__, i.e. __add__ data to the table, __if__ the operation is successful.
- `INSERT` is the `CREATE` portion of `CRUD`, which is what `DML`is all about
- The __structure__ of the table __and__ the __schema__ of the database __are not changed in any way__.
