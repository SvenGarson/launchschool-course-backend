The following __psql meta-command__:

```
\d things
```

is a wrapper for the SQL `DDL` - Data Definition Sub-Language because it returns a __textual description__ of:

- the __structure/schema__ of the `things` table which contains, amongst others:
  - table name
  - column names
  - table and column constraints
