Approach for query that returns the __largest number of bids__ made from an __individual bidder__ using a subquery:

1. Group the bids into virtual tables based on bidder id and count the bids for each individual bidder.

   ```sql
   SELECT count(bidder_id) AS total_bids FROM bids
   GROUP BY bidder_id;
   ```

2. Get the maximum number of bids from the resulting table from step `1`:

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(total_bids)
   FROM
     (SELECT COUNT(bidder_id) AS total_bids FROM bids GROUP BY bidder_id)
     AS bid_counts;
   ```
