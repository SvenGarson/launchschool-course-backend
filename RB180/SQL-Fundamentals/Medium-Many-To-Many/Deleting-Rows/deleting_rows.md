In order to delete the `Bulk Email` service from the `services` table, the first thing that needs to be done is to delete all of the referencing record from any other table, in this case namely from the `customers_services` table.

The problem here is that the `customers_services.service_id` Foreign Key is __does not have a constraint of `ON DELETE CASCADE`__, which means that records that reference some service are __not__ automatically deleted __if the service is deleted from the `services` table__.

So we must:

1. Delete every record in the `customers_services` table that reference the `Bulk Email` record:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customers_services
   WHERE service_id = (SELECT id FROM services WHERE description = 'Bulk Email');
   ```

2. Delete the service from the `services` table:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM services
   WHERE description = 'Bulk Email';
   ```

3. Delete the customer named `Chen Ke-Hua`:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customers
   WHERE name = 'Chen Ke-Hua';
   ```
